<p class="lead">After years of designing, exploring, and multiple restarts, I've set a deadline for my personal website. I've got around 5 different designs in my Dropbox, but it's time to stop tinkering and start delivering.</p>

During this year's vacation, I challenged myself to create a new site (the 6th design I guess) and have it ready for "production" by the end of my break. Well, here it is! It's not finished, but I'm happy with it.

My last article dates back to 2011â€”almost 13 years ago. That needed to change since I have a lot of ideas for topics that I just want do dive into myself but I just didn't get myself to do it. With this new site, I have no excuse; I can freely think, write, and share it with everyone who might want to read along.

The site is a work in progress, but instead of overthinking, I've decided to start and improve one step at a time.

## Things I'm happy with
- I love the font pairing (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora">Lora</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair">Playfair</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro">Source Code Pro</a>)
- Easy workflow for publishing with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>
- Hosting on <a href="https://github.com/luctiemessen/luctiemessen.github.io">GitHub</a> is a blast
- The CSS is kept really simple
- Got to dip my toes in Astro, and I like it

## Some todos
- Thorough accessibility check
- The footer needs a bit of love
- CSS Code cleanup (housekeeping)
- Check if Google Fonts calls can be minimized
- Might tinker with the font sizing for smaller devices
- I'll probably find a lot more soon :)

For now I whish you all a very happy, productive, memorable 2024 and let's start today with new healthy habits!

Enjoy and thanks for reading along.
