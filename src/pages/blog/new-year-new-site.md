<p class="lead">After years and years of designing, exploring, starting over, polishing and starting over, I've finally started setting a deadline for my own personal website. I think I have around 5 totally different designs floating around somewhere in my Dropbox but is finally time to quit tinkering and start delivering. </p>

This years' vacation I decided to give myself a goal to come up with this new site (the 6th design I guess) and make sure it is ready to use and in "production" at the end of my vacation. Well, here it is! And I'm happy with it althoug is it far from finished, but that's fine!

My last article dates back from 2011... that is almost 13 years ago. This needed to change since I have a lot of ideas for topics that I just want do dive into myself but I just didn't get myself to do it. With this new site, there is no excuse anymore, I can now freely think, write and share it with everyone who might want to read along.

The site is work in progress, but as all designers are always polishing and polising every detail, I really wanted to get started and not overthink things too much. Is it good enough? What is good enough? When is it good enough? Let's just start and keep track of these things and improve, one step at a time.

## Things I'm happy with
- I love the font pairing (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora">Lora</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair">Playfair</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro">Source Code Pro</a>)
- Easy workflow for publishing with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>
- Hosting on <a href="https://github.com/luctiemessen/luctiemessen.github.io">GitHub</a> is a blast
- The CSS is kept really simple
- Got to dip my toes in Astro, and I like it

## Some todos
- Thorough accessibility check
- The footer needs a bit of love
- CSS Code cleanup (housekeeping)
- Check if Google Fonts calls can be minimized
- Might tinker with the font sizing for smaller devices
- I'll probably find a lot more soon :)

For now I whish you all a very happy, productive, memorable 2024 and let's start today with new healthy habits!

Enjoy and thanks for reading along.
