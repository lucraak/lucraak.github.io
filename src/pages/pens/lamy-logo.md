The model seems to be introduced in 1984 (with a ballpoint (blue, red and green) and mechanical pensil (0.5mm lead) black(?), blue, red and green).
In 1985 there was also a white version of both pens.

Page 26 tells that 1986 was the introduction of the a Lamy Logo (FH) fountain pen. In a steel finish. Most probably similar to the one with the steel finish and the black top and end cap [reference needed].
